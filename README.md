**Communication and Insights**
The top hashtag relating to the show was #MrsChatterjeeVsNowey. This would be as a result of the fact that it is the movie’s name, it makes sense for people to have made a tweet with the above hashtag and it’s only normal that people would want to continue with that for visibility case; a total 7.6k hashtags was made. This tweet is also the most liked and most retweeted this was followed by the major cast #RaniMukerji, it has 1.6k hashtag, this is natural consider how she spawned passion, anger, agony, love, persistence, emotions into her cast, tell the word the love and the pain of a mother whose kids have been taken away from her forcefully on the pretext of improper parenting.  
The sentiment analysis shows.  64.96% of Twitter had something positive to say about the movies, 23.74% were not happy with the movie, they have something negative to say and 11.3% where neutral about the movie

Based on the sentiment/emotional scores from tweets analysed I observe the following sentiments and their corresponding counts and percentages and I report from 10 and above: Anticipation: 8600 occurrences, accounting for approximately 13.2% of the sentiment score. Joy: 7146 occurrences, accounting for approximately 11.0% of the sentiment score. Negative: 6800 occurrences, accounting for approximately 10.0% of the sentiment score. Positive: 13746 occurrences, accounting for approximately 21.1% of the sentiment Trust: 11200 occurrences, accounting for approximately 17.3% of the sentiment score.

## Descriptive Analysis
I wanted to know the number of transaction or number of sales units made for each product that was sold in one hand and knowing the retailer with the most product unit sold in other hand: Foot Locker had the most unit sold and was followed by West Gear. For retailers with the least number of sales transactions is Walmart. Men's Street Footwear and Men's Athletic Footwear had the most sales unite. Men's Apparel and Women's Athletic Footwear had the lowest sold unit.

## Region Unit Sold
West Region has the most Adidas purchase transactions: 2448, and Southeast Region is the area with the fewest adidas purchase transactions: 1224 On June 5, 2021 and June 11, 2021 in Omaha, Midwest region, state of Nebraska in second quarter, Woman's Athletic Footwear products did not sell at Foot Locker. it should be investigated what happened in the month of June to avoid future occurrence.

## Recommendation 
The manager, may want to look into the two stores that under performed during 2021 to work on improving their performance. In contrast, He may want to look into the two stores that outperformed during 2021 to find out if their best practices can be replicated in other locations.
